## Professional Biography
I am Jash, a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati. I grew up in Mumbai, India and have had an interest in computer science since high school.
As i progressed in my college career, I have gained interest and passion for web development. Web is something the whole world uses in some fashion or the other, and has undoubtedly had a significant impact on our society. And yet so few people know how it works, and how it far exceeds than just html, as intro classes would lead one to believe.
Following my interests has led me to gain industry experience at various companies. My last internship was at a company called Rokt, in New York City. I was mainly a front-end engineer using React.
Additionally, I have interned at a company called London Computer Systems (LCS), and worked on a rent management software in Angular.
Apart from that, I like to stay involved on campus and was the Director of a hackathon and President of [ACM@UC](https://acmatuc.org/) during the year of 2021-2022.

## Project Sought
As of now, I want to use my capstone to learn more web development skills and explore new technologies. There are some ideas that I have that I want to discuss, like an idea my teammates came up with in a hackathon. I would also like to explore projects that may help small businesses.
