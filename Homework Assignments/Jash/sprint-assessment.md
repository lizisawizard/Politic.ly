## Part A
As a full stack engineer, I mostly worked on setting up the backend APIs and a little bit of the front end. I also set up our CI/CD using railway.app and netlify. I applied my skills in Node.js for the backend and some architecture knowledge. The skill I built on was deploying projects both in front-end and back-end and making sure they interact with each other seamlessly.

My major successes were having  an application that works end to end. Our deployment was seamless, for both backend and front end, and so were our development environment where the set up time and effort were minimal. One of my obstacles was setting up the front end deployment on netlify and setting up google sso login. User management is aways challenging, and implementing it in our backend and getting environment variables and authorized URLs to work with google sso was the biggest obstacle I overcame.

## Part B
Our biggest accomplishment was having a user friendly web application that works end to end. We had proper routing, https requests, and design components. Users could log in, create initiatives, events and announcements.  I learned that assigning and dividing task is not easy and agile methodology works the best when doing so.  Still, agile can get tricky when working in a school setting since peopleâ€™s schedule looks different every week.
