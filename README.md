# Politic.ly
Team name: 2%
Team members: Alex Mills, Liz Tremblay, Jash Gada
Advisor: Dr. Nan Niu

A web/mobile app designed to bring members of the local community together and educate users about their local politics and encourage them to take initiatives to bring positive change in their communities. This app aims to empower young adults in the society to take action and shed light to the importance of local policies on a communityâ€™s betterment.

# Project Description
This project aims to bring an average American community closer and help create impact within their local environment. While national politics and policies are important, they get plenty of platforms to communicate with citizens. However, local politics rarely get the same level of attention. Through this app, we want to make local politics accessible, especially to young adults who are the most motivated to bring about change. We want to allow local citizens to create initiatives, gather support, and take action to make their communities better.
