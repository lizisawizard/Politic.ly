## Assignment 4
User Stories + Design Diagrams<br />

### User Stories
Users include young voters, community members and politicians.<br />
1. As a community member, I want to follow initiatives and receive notifications about them to stay up to date with them
2. As a community member, I cannot view other users’ initiatives they’re following so I cannot form a political opinion about their person
3. As a politician, I want to endorse initiatives hosted by community members to show my support
4. As a community member, I want to show my support for initiatives through financial means
5. As a young voter, I want to know when local elections occur on so I can make my voice heard <br />
